# Contributing to Cache Me If You Can

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this educational Redis caching project! This project is designed to help people learn about caching patterns, Docker orchestration, and microservice architecture.

## üéØ Project Goals

This project aims to:
- Provide a hands-on learning experience for Redis caching
- Demonstrate cache-aside patterns in a realistic microservice environment
- Show real-time performance differences between cached and uncached requests
- Serve as a template for similar educational projects

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker (20.10+) and Docker Compose (2.0+)
- Git
- Basic knowledge of Python, JavaScript, or Docker

### Local Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/cache-me-if-you-can.git`
3. Navigate to the project: `cd cache-me-if-you-can`
4. Start the services: `docker compose up -d --build`
5. Test the setup: Visit http://localhost:3000

### Contribution Process

1. **Check existing issues** - Look for related issues or create a new one
2. **Fork and branch** - Create a feature branch from `main`
3. **Make changes** - Follow the coding standards below
4. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure all services work correctly
5. **Update documentation** - Update README if needed
6. **Submit PR** - Create a pull request with clear description

## üìù Coding Standards

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Use async/await for database and cache operations

### Frontend (Astro/JavaScript)
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Follow modern JavaScript practices (ES6+)
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Add comments for complex logic

### Docker & Infrastructure
- Use multi-stage builds where appropriate
- Include health checks for services
- Use named volumes with descriptive names
- Document environment variables
- Follow security best practices

## üß™ Testing Your Changes

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] All services start successfully: `docker compose up -d --build`
- [ ] Frontend loads at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] API documentation accessible at http://localhost:8000/docs
- [ ] Product lookup works (test cache miss and hit)
- [ ] Cache statistics display correctly
- [ ] Cache clear functionality works
- [ ] pgAdmin connects automatically
- [ ] Redis Commander shows cached data

### Performance Testing
- Test cache hit/miss performance differences
- Verify memory usage remains reasonable
- Check for any memory leaks during extended use
- Ensure services recover gracefully from failures
